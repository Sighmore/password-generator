Generate Password: Click the "Generate Password" button to generate a random password based on the specified length.

Use Cases

Password Creation: This tool generates strong, unique passwords for various applications, such as email accounts, social media, or online banking.
Security: It ensures that the generated passwords are a mix of character types, making them more difficult to guess or crack.
Convenience: Users can easily generate passwords without manually creating them, reducing the risk of using weak or easily guessable passwords.

Technical Details

JavaScript: The script uses JavaScript to generate the password based on the user's input.
Randomization: The script uses the Math.random() function to generate random characters from the specified character sets.
